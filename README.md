# Bookstore Application

This is the second project made with a databse in my .NET education. In this project, we develop an application in C# that uses the Entity Framework to allow users to read and update data in a database. 

The choice was whether to make a Console or WPF App, as long as the functionality is in place. In the first project, we created a database with the funcionality of a bookstore - in which I have futher developed into an UI application. The assignment is as follows:

Write an application connected to the bookstore database that you created in lab 1. The user must be able to list the stock balance for the various stores, as well as be able to add and remove books from the stores. When you add books, you must be able to choose from all the books that are already in the assortment (the book table).

### Set up before running this application:
Download the bak. file and restore to your local database - the file is located in the folder Backup. Then add your connectionstring to the BookstoreContext.cs file (BookstoreApplication.Infrastructure.Models).
